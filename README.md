WebXR needs HTTPS. So host project or create an ssl via openssl to work local.

This project doesn't work properly anymore. It needs lots of fixes. Openssl is not an ideal solution for the WebXR https problem. The qr code which used in project deprecated and node-sass is also deprecated. I'll fix these problems or maybe code this project from scratch in future. Also you can check the link to watch the preview of this project, if you are curious about how was it while working properly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMWL8BOaFg
